# Quick Fix for Render Deployment Error

If you're seeing this error when deploying to Render:

```
SyntaxError: Missing catch or finally after try
```

## Option 1: Switch to the fallback_bot.js

The recommended solution is to use the fallback_bot.js file instead of polling_bot.js in your Render deployment:

1. Go to your Render Dashboard
2. Select your Laika CX service 
3. Click on "Settings"
4. Find the "Start Command" setting
5. Change it from `node polling_bot.js` to `node fallback_bot.js`
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Manually trigger a redeploy

## Option 2: Fix polling_bot.js directly

If you want to continue using polling_bot.js:

1. In polling_bot.js, the error is around line 97
2. The issue is a missing `catch` block for the outer try statement
3. Add a proper catch block like this:

```javascript
  } catch (outerError) {
    console.error('Error in generateDeepSeekResponse:', outerError);
    return 'I apologize, but I am experiencing some technical difficulties. Please try again later or contact our support team directly.';
  }
```

4. Push the changes to GitHub
5. Redeploy on Render

## Option 3: Use the Fixed Version

We've already fixed the error in both files:

- polling_bot.js (fixed the syntax error)
- fallback_bot.js (improved version with better error handling)

Both should now deploy correctly on Render.

## Common Issues with Render Deployment:

1. **Environment Detection**: Make sure Node.js is selected as the environment
2. **Start Command**: Use `node fallback_bot.js` for the most reliable operation
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify both API keys are set correctly
4. **GitHub Repository**: Make sure your latest changes are pushed to GitHub
