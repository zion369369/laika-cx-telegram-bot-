# Fixing the DeepSeek API Issue

This guide will help you troubleshoot and fix the DeepSeek API integration issues.

## The Problem

Your bot is receiving messages and running on Render, but it's responding with an error message:

```
I apologize, but I am experiencing some technical difficulties at the moment. Please try again later or contact our support team directly.
```

This indicates that the bot is having trouble connecting to the DeepSeek API.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Update to the Fixed Polling Bot

I've created a fixed version of your polling bot with:
- Better error handling
- More detailed logging
- Improved user-facing error messages

1. In Render, update your Start Command to:
   ```
   node fixed_polling_bot.js
   ```

### Solution 2: Check DeepSeek API Endpoint

There might be an issue with the DeepSeek API URL. Try these alternatives:

Alternative 1:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post('https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai/chat/completions', {
  model: 'deepseek-ai/deepseek-chat-v1',
  ...
```

Alternative 2:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/deepseek-ai/deepseek-chat-v1', {
  inputs: prompt,
  ...
```

### Solution 3: Use a Different AI Model Provider

If DeepSeek API continues to have issues, consider switching to OpenAI, Hugging Face, or another provider:

```javascript
// Example for OpenAI
const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: prompt }
  ],
  temperature: 0.7
}, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  }
});
```

### Solution 4: Check API Key Format

Your confirmed DeepSeek API key is: `sk-8e3db7a1fabe4f4a8bb44348d2761343`

Make sure the API key is set up correctly:
- It should be set as an environment variable in Render
- If the API key requires a "Bearer " prefix, the code has been updated to include it
- The key has been verified to be in the correct format for DeepSeek

### Solution 5: View Detailed Error Logs

With the fixed polling bot, you can see detailed error logs in your Render service logs to better understand what's going wrong with the DeepSeek API.
